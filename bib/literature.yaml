    In this paper, we propose a Riemannian version of the difference of convex
    algorithm (DCA) to solve a minimization problem involving the difference of
    convex (DC) function. We establish the equivalence between the classical and
    simplified Riemannian versions of the DCA. We also prove that, under mild
    assumptions, the Riemannian version of the DCA is well-defined, and every
    cluster point of the sequence generated by the proposed method, if any, is a
    critical point of the objective DC function. Additionally, we establish some
    duality relations between the DC problem and its dual. To illustrate the
    effectiveness of the algorithm, we present some numerical experiments.
