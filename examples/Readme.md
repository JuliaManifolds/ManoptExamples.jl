# Setup Quarto to run these examples locally

To run the examples locally, you need [Quarto](https://quarto.org) installed on your system,
see [the Quarto Julia installation guide](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/julia.html#installation).
The remainder should be setup automatically by the environment (`Project.toml` and `_quarto.yml`) in this folder.
