This package provides a set of example tasks for [Manopt.jl](https://manoptjl.org/) based on either generic
manifolds from the [ManifoldsBase.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/ManifoldsBase.jl/) interface or specific manifolds from [Manifolds.jl](https://juliamanifolds.github.io/Manifolds.jl/).

Each example usually consists of

* a cost function and additional objects, like the gradient or proximal maps, see [objectives](objectives/index.md)
* an example explaining how to use these, see [examples](examples/index.md)

Helping functions that are used in one or more examples can be found in the section of functions in the menu.
